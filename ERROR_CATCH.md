## Launch/Startup Errors

### `Package 'prl_ur5_run' not found`
**Cause:** You forgot to source the workspace after building.
**Fix:**
```bash
source ~/share/ws/install/setup.bash
```

### `Controller not available after X seconds`
**Cause:** The MoveIt trajectory controller has not started.
**Fix:**
- Ensure the `prl_ur5_run` launch file started the correct controllers.
- For real robots, check the UR controller on the teach pendant.

### `No message on <topic> within timeout`
**Cause:** Camera or TF data is not being published.
**Fix:**
- Check `ros2 topic list` for expected topics.
- Restart camera drivers or reconnect USB.
- For TF issues, ensure all required robot_state_publisher and static_transform_publisher nodes are running.

## Policy Server Errors

### `ConnectionRefusedError` when sending batch
**Cause:** Policy server is not reachable.
**Fix:**
- Verify SSH tunnel to CLEPS server:
```bash
ssh -N -L 8002:gpu017:8002 cleps -i ~/.ssh/jz_rsa
```
- Ensure `--ip` matches `localhost` and port matches the forwarded port.

### `requests.exceptions.Timeout`
**Cause:** Policy server too slow or unresponsive.
**Fix:**
- Increase server resources (`salloc` with more CPU/GPU).
- Reduce image/point cloud sizes to speed up transmission.

## Robot Execution Errors

### `"Failed to move the robot"`
**Cause:** Motion planning or execution failed.
**Fix:**
- Check if target pose is outside `WORKSPACE` bounds.
- Verify MoveIt collision environment is correct.
- Try joint-space planning by disabling `cartesian_only`.

### `Gripper moved to position ...` but no movement observed
**Cause:** Incorrect IO pin or controller not active.
**Fix:**
- Verify `/left_io_and_status_controller/set_io` exists:
```bash
ros2 service list | grep set_io
```
- Check teach pendant IO configuration.

## Camera/Point Cloud Errors

### `ValueError: cannot reshape array`
**Cause:** Depth or RGB data size mismatch.
**Fix:**
- Ensure correct `dtype` is passed to `record_image` (`np.uint8` for RGB, `np.uint16` for depth).
- If hardware setup changed, verify `CameraInfo` intrinsics.

## Simulation-Specific Issues

### Gripper not actuating in sim
**Explanation:** In `use_sim_time` mode, gripper execution is skipped by design.
**Fix:** This is expected. Use MoveIt gripper component if you want simulated gripper control.

## General Debug Tips

- **Check ROS graph**: `ros2 node list` and `ros2 topic list`
- **Inspect data**: `ros2 topic echo` and RViz visualization
- **Mock mode**: Switch to `mock_predict()` for isolating robot vs. policy issues
- **Logging**: RoboMaestro logs include call chain for easier tracing

## Emergency Stop
If the robot behaves unexpectedly:
1. Hit the physical **E-STOP** button immediately.
2. Investigate logs and last commanded action.
